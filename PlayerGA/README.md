# Game Playing Agent for CoinTex using Genetic Algorithm
This project builds a game playing agent that plays CoinTex. CoinTex is a cross-platform open-source game developed in Python using a framework called [Kivy](https://kivy.org). 

The source code of CoinTex is available at the root of the [CoinTex GitHub project](https://github.com/ahmedfgad/CoinTex). Being developed in Kivy, CoinTex is available for Android at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coin.tex.cointexreactfast&hl=en).

The only AI used to build the agent is the genetic algorithm (GA). There is no machine/deep learning model used. The [PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io) library is used to build the GA. 

# Installing PyGAD

[PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io) is the library used for building the genetic algorithm (GA). Check the documentation at [Read the Docs](https://pygad.readthedocs.io) to get started.

The minimum PyGAD version that works with this project is 2.4.0. A lower version does not support 2 features that are necessary in this work which are:

1. The `delay_after_gen` parameter in the `pygad.GA` class's constructor that puts the GA into sleep for a number of seconds after each generation.
2. The function passed to the `callback_generation` parameter of the `pygad.GA` class's constructor returns the string `stop` returned to stop the GA before visiting all the generations.

[PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io) can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) using the `pip` installer. For Windows, use the following CMD command:

```
pip install pygad
```

For Linux and Mac, replace `pip`  by `pip3` because PyGAD uses Python 3:

```
pip3 install pygad
```

Once being installed, make sure it works well by importing it. The latest version at the time of writing this tutorial is **2.4.0** or higher. 

```python
import pygad

print(pygad.__version__)
```

# Run the Project

To run the project, just run the `main.py` file.

In Windows, use this CMD command:

```
python main.py
```

For Linux/Mac, use `python3` rather than `python`:

```
python3 main.py
```

A window appears like the shows below. Normally, the game only activates the levels that the user completed successfully plus 1 more level. Specially for this project, all the levels are activated.

After the main screen of the app appears, select any of the activated levels and the agent will play it automatically [hoping to pass the level successfully].

# For More Information

The game is developed in Kivy and the agent is created using the genetic algorithm. To get started with Kivy, check the following resources:
